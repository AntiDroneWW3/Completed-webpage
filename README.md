ARJUNA

Arjuna is the python script that uses a camera to track your hand and arduino based laser turret (aka TIMBY: Targeted Intruder Mitigation by Beaconed Yield) will follow drone with high accuracy.
Code is messy as it was made with low time on hand.

open Arjuna.py and put Angles.py in the same folder as Arjuna.py

make sure to install opencv, cvzone, mediapipe, numpy and serial libraries

open Timby.ino in Arduino and upload it to your microcontroller

run Arjuna.py after ensuring the com port is same to which your arduino is connected to

it should work!

the stl files for the turret are in the stl folder
